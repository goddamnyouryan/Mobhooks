If we make changes to the Terms, we will make reasonable efforts to post the changes before they become effective and to specify the date they will become effective.  But, if we don’t specify a date, the changes are effective immediately.  Your continued use of MobHooks means that you accept those changes.</p>

Registered Users agree to promptly notify us of any unauthorized use of their confidential login and account information, password(s), personal identification number and other related information by emailing us at support@MobHooks.com.  In addition, Registered Users agree to exit from their account at the end of each session.</p>

You acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible or liable for the accuracy or availability of Third-Party Content or for any viruses or other damaging elements encountered in linking to Third-Party Content or websites.

<ul>
<li>Post to MobHooks any User Submission whatsoever that is or could appear to be: untrue, misleading,  harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, tortuous, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, libelous, invasive to another person's privacy or protected data, hateful, or racially, ethnically or otherwise objectionable;</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>11. Customer Service </strong></p>
<p>You may contact MobHooks customer service by sending an email to support@MobHooks.com. We suggest that you first contact the Offer provider in the event a dispute arises. Given that we act as an agent in selling products, services or special deals on behalf of Providers, we may simply not have sufficient information to answer all your questions or resolve every issue. You acknowledge that the provision of customer support is at our sole discretion, and that we have no obligation to provide you with comprehensive customer support. All purchasing disputes are solely between you and Provider.  We may however provide you with customer support from time to time, at our sole discretion, provided that you are a Registered User and purchased an Underlying Product (as defined in the Terms of Sale below) using your account.  Obviously, we’d like all of our customers to have an excellent buying experience so please let us know if that’s not the case.  Please note, we will continue to improve support over time.</p>

YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT MOBHOOKS, LLC AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, PARTNERS AND LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES (EVEN IF MOBHOOKS, LLC HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), RESULTING FROM USE OF THE SITE OR SERVICES, CONTENT OR ANY RELATED SERVICES.</p>

<p><strong>13. Modification, Termination or Cancellation </strong></p>
<p>You agree that we may, at any time and at our sole discretion, with or without cause or any notice to you, terminate these Terms, your access to MobHooks, and/or your account, or suspend or block your access to the MobHooks.  You will still be liable for any breaches of these Terms and/or obligations incurred before the Terms end. The provisions of these Terms concerning Site security, prohibited activities, intellectual property, User Submissions, disclaimer, limitation of liability, indemnity and jurisdictional issues shall survive any termination.  You agree that if your use of MobHooks is terminated pursuant to these Terms, you will not attempt to use MobHooks under any name, real or assumed, and further agree that if you violate this restriction after being terminated, you indemnify and hold us harmless from any and all liability that we may incur therefore.</p>

<p><strong>14. Indemnification </strong></p>
<p>As a condition of use you agree to indemnify and hold MobHooks (and its officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, joint ventures, and employees) harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, or arising out of or related to 1) your breach of these Terms or Privacy Policy; or 2) your activities in connection with MobHooks.</p>

<p><strong>15. Arbitration </strong></p>
<p>By using the Site and Services, you agree that: (1) any claim, dispute, or controversy you may have against MobHooks arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way with these Terms, the Site and Services or the purchase or sale of any Underlying Product (as defined in the Terms of Sale below), shall be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and conducted before a single arbitrator pursuant to the applicable Rules and Procedures established by AAA (“Rules and Procedures”); (2) the arbitration shall be held at a location determined by AAA pursuant to the Rules and Procedures (provided that such location is reasonably convenient for you), or at such other location as may be mutually agreed upon by you and MOBHOOKS, LLC.; (3) the arbitrator shall apply California law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law; (4) there shall be no authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class or representative basis; arbitration can decide only your and/or MOBHOOKS, LLC.’s individual claims; and the arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated; (5) in the event that the you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, MOBHOOKS, LLC. will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive; and (6) with the exception of subpart (4) above, if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures established by AAA, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, subpart (4) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration Provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor MOBHOOKS, LLC shall be entitled to arbitrate your dispute. For more information on AAA and its Rules and Procedures, you may visit the AAA website and service at http://www.adr.org.</p>

<p><strong>16. Additional Terms </strong></p>
<p>a. Severance. If any part of the Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the invalid or unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible and the remainder will remain in full force and effect, provided that the allocation of risks described herein is given effect to the fullest extent possible.</p>
	
<p>b. No Assignment. These Terms (including terms incorporated into them) are personal to you and you may not transfer, assign or delegate them to anyone without our express written permission. Any attempt by you to assign, transfer or delegate these Terms without our express written permission will be null and void. We shall have the right to transfer, assign and/or delegate these Terms to one or more third parties without your permission.</p>
	
<p>c. Jurisdiction; Choice of Law; Export Limitations. The Site and Services are controlled by us from our offices within the United States of America. If you choose to access the Site and Services from locations outside the U.S., you do so at your own risk and you are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws. </p>
	
<p>d. Limitations on Actions. Any action concerning any dispute you may have with respect to the Site and Services must be commenced within one year after the cause of the dispute arises, or the cause of action is barred.</p>

<p>e. Paragraph Headings. The paragraph headings in these Terms are included to help make theseTerms easier to read and have no binding effect.</p>
	
<p>f. Entire Agreement. These Terms (including terms incorporated into them) comprise the entire agreement (the "Entire Agreement") between you and MOBHOOKS, LLC with respect to the use of MobHooks and supersedes all contemporaneous and prior agreements between the parties regarding the subject matter contained herein, and neither party has relied on any representations made by the other that are not expressly set forth in the Entire Agreement.</p>
	
<p>g. No Waiver. The failure of MOBHOOKS, LLC. to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms, including any failure to act with respect to a breach, will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision or our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. We suggest that you print out a copy of these Terms for your records.</p>
	
<p><strong>B. TERMS OF SALE</strong></p>

<p>An Offer provides an opportunity to purchase a product directly from a Provider (a “Promotional Item”) or a product, service or special deal redeemable through a Provider (a “Promotional Voucher”) (collectively, “Underlying Products”).  All purchased Promotional Items will be shipped by the Provider and all purchased Promotional Vouchers may be exchanged for goods or services from the Provider. </p>
	
<p><strong>1. General </strong></p>
<p>MobHooks markets Offers on behalf of Providers. MOBHOOKS, LLC. is not responsible for any and all injuries, illnesses, damages, claims, liabilities and costs suffered by a customer, caused in whole or in part by the Underlying Product or for any unclaimed property liability arising from unredeemed or partially redeemed Promotional Voucher. </p>

<p>By responding to a given Offer, you agree to purchase the Underlying Product based on the terms and conditions associated with the Offer and the terms and conditions stated herein. If the terms of an Offer are inconsistent with these Terms, the Offer’s specific terms supersede any inconsistent terms in these Terms, except to the extent such terms are prohibited by applicable law.</p>

<p>In order to respond to an Offer or to purchase any Underlying Product, you must be a Registered User. The Provider, not MOBHOOKS, LLC., is the seller of the Underlying Products and is solely responsible for fulfilling any Underlying Product purchased according to the terms of the Offer.  </p>

<p><strong>2. How It Works</strong></p>
<p>All Registered Users receive Offers in the form of a text message.  If a Registered User wishes to purchase an Underlying Product according to the terms of the Offer, the Registered User must reply to the text message Offer using the Registered User’s PIN.  If the Offer is still valid and available the Registered User will then receive a reply text detailing the purchase confirmation and all other applicable details.  If the Offer is no longer available or sold out, the Registered User will receive a reply text containing the applicable details.  </p>

<p><strong>3. Terms and Conditions: Promotional Items, Returns & Refunds</strong></p>
<p>All Promotional Item purchase amounts may be only applied to merchandise sold by Provider, and may not be applied to shipping or handling charges unless otherwise stated in the Offer or by the Provider.</p>
	
<p>The issuing of Provider credit is at the sole discretion of the Provider unless otherwise required by law. </p>
	
<p>Offer purchases cannot be combined with any other Offers, third party certificates or promotions unless otherwise specified by Provider.</p>
	
<p>Reproduction, sale or trade of Promotional Items is prohibited unless done so in compliance with applicable law. </p>
	
<p>Void to the extent where prohibited by law. </p>
	
<p>All the terms included in an Offer are subject to change. We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue an Offer, at any time, with or without notice. You agree that we will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuance of any Offer. In the event an Offer includes an incorrect price or information due to typographical error, error in pricing or due to incorrect information received from the Providers, we shall have the right to decline or cancel any orders made pursuant to the incorrect terms, whether or not the order has been confirmed and/or your credit card charged. If your credit card has already been charged for the order and we cancel your order, we shall issue a credit to your credit card account in the amount of the charge.</p>
	
<p>For each Underlying Product you purchase using MobHooks you agree to pay the price applicable and contained in the Offer as well as the delivery fees for the Underlying Product (“Delivery Fees”), and any applicable Taxes (as defined below). We will automatically bill your credit card as part of the order process and you hereby authorize us to do so. You will be solely responsible for payment of all taxes (other than taxes based on our income), fees, duties, and other governmental charges, and any related penalties and interest, arising from the Underlying Product purchase (“Taxes”) not withheld by us. All payments are non-refundable. </p>
	
<p>Your receipt of an order confirmation from us does not signify our acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of our offer to sell. We reserve the right at any time after receipt of your order to accept or decline or cancel your order (in whole or in part) for any reason. We may require additional verification or information before accepting any order. Your order is not accepted until you physically receive your Underlying Product. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you agree that, if we cancel all or a part of your order, your sole and exclusive remedy is either that (a) we will issue a credit to your credit card account in the amount charged for the cancelled portion (if your credit card has already been charged for the order) or (b) we will not charge your credit card for the cancelled portion of the order.</p>
	
<p>Any delivery dates that we provide are estimates. We reserve the right to make deliveries in installments if necessary. We will send you an email when your order has a confirmed tracking number given by the Provider. Currently, we only ship in the United States.  </p>
	
<p>All Underlying Product or Voucher purchases and transactions conducted through MobHooks are final unless otherwise explicitly stated in the Offer. Of course if something happens, please let us know by emailing us: support@MobHooks.com or dialing customer service at 1(800) 775-0924. We will attempt to provide you the correct information for contacting the Offer Provider.  Your correspondence or business dealings regarding Offers and Underlying Products including delivery of related goods or services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and the Provider of the Underlying Product. You waive any claim against MOBHOOKS, LLC. and agree to hold MOBHOOKS, LLC. harmless from any loss or damage of any kind incurred as the result of any such dealings or as the result of the presence of such Providers on MobHooks.</p>
	
<p>We do not exchange any Underlying Products for other Underlying Products.</p>

<p><strong>4. Terms and Conditions: Promotional Vouchers</strong></p>
<p>Offer details may be found by “clicking” a link provided at the bottom of each text message Offer which leads to and displays a WAP Mobile Page with additional specifications. STANDARD DATA RATES MAY APPLY. </p>
	
<p>Promotional Vouchers cannot be used for taxes, tips or prior balances with Provider, unless permitted by the Provider. </p>
	
<p>Use of a Promotional Voucher for alcoholic beverages is at the sole discretion of the Provider and is subject to compliance with applicable law.</p>
	
<p>Promotional Vouchers cannot be combined with any other Promotional Voucher, third party certificates, coupons, or promotions, unless otherwise permitted or specified by Provider. </p>
	
<p>The issuing of Provider credit is at the sole discretion of the Provider unless otherwise required by applicable law. </p>
	
<p>Neither MOBHOOKS, LLC. nor the Provider is responsible for lost or stolen Promotional Vouchers or Promotional Voucher reference numbers. </p>
	
<p>Reproduction, sale or trade of a Promotional Voucher is prohibited. </p>
	
<p>Any attempted redemption of a Promotional Voucher that is not consistent with these Terms will render the Promotional Voucher void. </p>
	
<p>For Restaurants: Valid only for dine in use unless otherwise stated by the in the Offer. </p>
	
<p>Void to the extent where prohibited by law. </p>
	
<p>If you redeem the Promotional Voucher for less than its face value, you will not be entitled to a credit or cash from the Provider unless required by applicable law. If so required by law, you will only be entitled to a credit or cash equal to the difference between the amount you paid for the Promotional Voucher (excluding any applicable Taxes and Delivery Fees) and the amount you redeemed. </p>
	
<p>Different jurisdiction may have statutes that dictate how a Promotional Voucher may be redeemed for alcoholic beverages. For example, for customers purchasing Promotional Vouchers for restaurants in Ohio, the redemption of the Promotional Voucher may be subject to the limitations imposed by the Ohio Revised Code Title [43] XLIII, Section 4301.01, which imposes a limitation of redeeming Promotional Vouchers at restaurants that serve both food and alcoholic and intoxicating liquor beverages, such that the redemption of such Promotional Voucher can only be applied to alcoholic and intoxicating liquor beverages for up to 30% of the value of the Promotional Voucher. Compliance with state statutes or codes (for example, the Ohio Revised Code) is the responsibility of the Provider. Our sole role in the transaction is as a marketing agent for the Provider. Thus, the applicability and compliance with any relevant statute or code is solely determined and consummated by the Provider, and we have no role and disclaim any role in such determination or action on the part of the Provider.</p>

<p><strong>5. Additional Terms and Conditions.</strong></p>
<p>All Offers shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the Offer, these Terms and any terms provided by the participating Provider. The Providers are the sellers of the Underlying Products.  The holder and issuer of an Underlying Product is the Provider. As a holder and issuer of the Underlying Product, the Provider shall be fully responsible for any and all injuries, illnesses, damages, claims, liabilities and costs suffered by or in respect of a customer, caused in whole or in part by the Provider or the Underlying Product, as well as for any unclaimed property liability arising from unredeemed Promotional Vouchers or portions thereof. You agree to waive, and release MOBHOOKS, LLC. and its officers, directors, employees and agents from, any claim, liabilities, damages, or injury arising from or related to any act or omission of a Provider in connection with an Offer or the Underlying Product and/or as it relates to compliance with applicable unclaimed property and other laws relating to the redemption of the Underlying Product or any portion thereof.  </p>

<p>Promotional Vouchers are redeemable in their entirety and on a one-time basis only and may not be redeemed incrementally unless otherwise specified by the Provider. According to applicable law, the Provider may be responsible for allowing you to redeem your Promotional Voucher for the purchase price based on the money you actually paid for the Promotional Voucher (i.e. if you paid $30 for a Promotional Voucher that gives you $65 of value to the Provider, the purchase price is $30, not $65), for a period of time that extends beyond the expiration date provided in Offer or with the Promotional Voucher (the “Expiration Date”). While the Expiration Date dictates the last date that you can redeem your Promotional Voucher at the Provider’s desired location, applicable law may provide that the Provider is responsible for honoring the purchase price of your Promotional Voucher for a period of time beyond the Expiration Date. In other words, you should be allowed to redeem the purchase price of your Offer up until the greater of: (1) the Offer’s expiration date; or (2) the minimum length of time allowed by applicable law for such Promotional Voucher to expire. In the event that you have an expired Promotional Voucher and would like to redeem it for the purchase price, please contact the Provider. Once again, the Provider should allow such redemption if applicable law requires it, and we have instructed the Provider to do so.  If you have gone to the Provider and the Provider has refused to redeem the purchase price of your expired Promotional Voucher, and if applicable law entitles you to such redemption, then please contact us by email at support@MobHooks.com provide a written explanation of your situation. If we determine that applicable law does in fact entitle you to redemption of the purchase price, we will refund the purchase price in either U.S. Dollars or reward points for purchases of future Underlying Products using MobHooks.</p>

<p><strong>C. TERMS OF POINTS SYSTEM</strong></p>

<p>By participating in the Points System, you fully accept the terms of this section of the Terms. Points may be earned by participating in MobHooks activities such as purchasing an item through MobHooks or referring an account sign up.  These activities are further described in the FAQ section of the Site and can also be found in the account holder administration section of the Site. Points are not available to minors under the age of 18 or to any Registered Users we suspend or remove from the system for any reason. Additionally, Registered Users are prohibited from selling, trading, or otherwise transferring Points to another party. </p>
	
<p>The Point System and Point values are subject to change without notice.

reasons, including, but not limited to, lack of appropriate
information or fraudulent information. MobHooks will not reward points for submissions that simply tell users how to unsubscribe or opt out to offers. These are not considered offers.</p>

<p>(e) MobHooks.com is not responsible for delays in
reporting points or failure to receive points.</p>

deducted for mailing paper checks. A user must have a minimum of 1,000
points ($10.00) in order to redeem points for cash. MobHooks will
