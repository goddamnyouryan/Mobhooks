<h2>About MobHooks</h2>

<p>MobHooks, short for “Mobile Hook-Ups”, is a text message (SMS/MMS) campaign sharing community, better known as THE FAMILY.  MobHooks is not affiliated with the mafia, but you get the point. We are just having fun with the name. </p>

The objective is for MobHooks to become the one stop directory for finding SMS  short codes and keywords to your favorite brands and local merchants so that you can gain access to special discounts and contests offered to their text club members.

<h2><u>PLEASE READ!</u></h2>
<p>*all campaigns, addresses, website URL’s, and images submitted will be verified by  MobHooks within 24 hours of submission although points and badges, if any, will be awarded immediately. Submitting <strong>any</strong> false information for a campaign will result in a double points deduction from your account on the first offense. In other words, if you submit a false campaign, you will get 200 points deducted from your account. If just the address is false, you would be deducted 20 points. You get the point. Second offense will result in a triple points deduction. Third offense will get you whacked, meaning you will be banned for life from MobHooks. We want the site to be helpful to all, so please help us keep all campaigns legit.</p>

<p><strong><u>**Submitting any campaigns, addresses, URL’s, or images that are considered pornographic or derogatory to any person or entity will result in automatic termination of account after just one offense. </u></strong></p>
